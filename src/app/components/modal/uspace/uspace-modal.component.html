                    U-Space is a user interface to detect drones based off of hardware such as radars, Radio Frequencies, and PTZ cameras.
                    <br>
                    This project was created under the CPNI specifications. It was less focused on design and more focused on functionality, as it incorperated a lot of hardware.
                    <br>
                    CPNI stands for Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. They are the UK governmentâ€™s National Technical Authority for physical and personnel protective security.

                    CPNI had very specific and detailed specifications, we followed a PDF file to ensure we had met all of the criteria.

                    Have ability to export data, have a good human machine interface

                    My role for this project was to be the Front End developer working in a small team alongside a senior developer
                    and a backend developer.
                    I would have to report back to the senior developer each time I completed a Jira ticket
                    There were no assigned designers so the design of the webapp was decided by the CEO or as a joint effort amongst the dev team.
