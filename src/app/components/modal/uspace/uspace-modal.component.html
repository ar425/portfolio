                    U-Space is a user interface to detect drones based off of hardware such as radars, Radio Frequencies, and PTZ cameras. Created for cpni as machine interface for 
                    detection hardware.
                    <br>
                    This project was created under the CPNI specifications. It was less focused on design and more focused on functionality, as it incorperated a lot of hardware.
                    <br>
                    CPNI stands for Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. They are the UK governmentâ€™s National Technical Authority for physical and personnel protective security.

                    Aside from the specifications and CPNI there was no other target audience.

                    CPNI had very specific and detailed specifications, we followed a PDF file to ensure we had met all of the criteria.

                <p class="modal-text" align="center">

                    My role for this project was to be the Front End developer working in a small team alongside a senior developer. Due to the small size of 
                    the team, i would sometimes be asked to do some tasks for the back end.
                    <br>
                    I would have to report back to the senior developer each time I completed a Jira ticket, he would then review my work and either tell me to fix
                    something or merge it into the main branch 
                    There were no assigned designers so the design of the webapp was decided by the CEO or as a joint effort amongst the dev team.

                <h3>Technologies</h3>
                <hr class="divider divider-light" />
                <p class="modal-text" align="center">
                    Third party libraries 
                    Other technologies
                    leaflet, geolocation
                    part of the requirements was to have a local map tiles - access without internet.
                    normally such files are very large, but by using docker/docker compose we were able to save on a lot of memory space.
                    react hooks, redux, jest
                    postgres, redis, django, nginx, celery, lodash, redux thunk, react-toastify, tailwind for quick iteration
                    react-datepicker - was simpler than to create our own datepicker
                    downloadjs, to download the csv file
                    immer, axios, fontawesome, sass 
                    docker compose to run the files, there were many different components
                    python scripts to control the hardware - ptz camera shell script - could use this through the terminal to reset the camera or move it.
                    the cameras ip address could also be accessed through a browser
                    <br>
                    What I learned whilst doing this project :
                    strengthened my knowledge of frontend development as well as gain 
                    a lot of valuable experience working with backend - I now have a very good understanding of full stack
