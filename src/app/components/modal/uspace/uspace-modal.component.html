                    U-Space is a user interface created for CPNI as a machine interface for detection hardware such as: radards, RF sensors, and PTZ cameras.
                    This hardware is used to detect drones, and the software allows a user to see these detections and choose what action they might want to take
                    from this information.
                    <br>
                    CPNI stands for Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. They are the UK governmentâ€™s National Technical Authority for physical and personnel protective security.
                    CPNI provided very detailed specifications in which they wanted this project to be competed. It was less focused on design and more focused on functionality, as it incorperated a lot of hardware.

                    The overall aim of this project was to pass CPNI's test criteria in order to be included in the CPNI Catalogue of Security Equipment.
                    They provided a PDF file with details of how to pass these test criteria, which we followed in extreme detail.

                    The user interface had to be intiutive and easy to use so that the operator wouldn't have any issues in using the system.
                    The user interface also needed to have the ability to export the tracked aircraft data - this would include things such as the
                    latitude and longitude of the aircraft, the altitude, time of detection, duration of detection and so on.
                    <br>
                    The aircraft activity had to be presented in a clear way, so that the user could easily understand what the hardware was picking up.

                <p class="modal-text" align="center">
                    My role for this project was to be the Front End developer working in a small team alongside a senior developer, However, due
                    to the small size of the team, I would sometimes be asked to do some tasks for the back end.
                    <br>
                    Throughout this project we did a lot of peer coding; through this I was able to gain a lot of experience regarding the inegration
                    of the hardware, as well as local and cloud databases, and the interaction between the back end and front end.
                    <br>
                    We used the agile workflow in order to keep track of the project. I would have to report back to the senior developer each time I completed a Jira ticket,
                    he would then review my work and give feedback on it.  
                    <br>
                    There were no assigned designers so the design of the user interface was based more around the functionality of hardware and other specifications
                    that CPNI had mentioned.
                    <br>
                    My involvement for this project was happening from August 2020 - January 2021.

                    This project was created with:

                <ul class="modal-list">
                    <li>react-toastify - for notifications of new detections</li>
                    <li>tailwind - for quick iteration</li>
                    <li>react-datepicker - it was simpler than creating a datepicker from scratch</li>
                    <li>downloadjs - to download the flight data</li>
                    <li>fontawesome - for some fun icons</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Python scripts were created to control the hardware, for example the PTZ camera shell script.
                    The script could be run through the terminal to move or reset the camera.

                    What I learned through this project:

                    I had the amazing opportunity to work with all of the technologies listed and get a much better
                    understanding of coding in general, as well as embed good practices regarding the agile workflow.
