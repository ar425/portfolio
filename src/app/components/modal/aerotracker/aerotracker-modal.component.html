        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p class="modal-text" align="center">
            This is a live flight tracker webapp, tracks aircrafts such as airplanes, helicopters, and drones
            It allows a user to create zones - receive notifications if the zone detects anything - filter
            aircraft by altitude or speed, and other things relating to aircraft.
            This interface integrates hardware such as radars and ADS-B, which is what allows it to display
            aircraft that this hardware is detecting.

            My role for this project was to be the Front End developer working in a small team alongside a senior developer
            and a backend developer.
            I would have to report back to the senior developer each time I completed a Jira ticket
            There were no assigned designers so the design of the webapp was decided by the CEO or as a joint effort amongst the dev team.
