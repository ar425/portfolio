                This is a live flight tracker webapp, tracks aircrafts such as airplanes, helicopters, and drones
                It allows a user to create zones - receive notifications if the zone detects anything - filter
                aircraft by altitude or speed, and other things relating to aircraft.
                This interface integrates hardware such as radars and ADS-B, which is what allows it to display
                aircraft that this hardware is detecting.

                My role for this project was to be the Front End developer working in a small team alongside a senior developer
                and a backend developer.
                I would have to report back to the senior developer each time I completed a Jira ticket
                There were no assigned designers so the design of the webapp was decided by the CEO or as a joint effort amongst the dev team.
