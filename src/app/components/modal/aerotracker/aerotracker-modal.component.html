                    AeroTracker is a live flight tracker user interface which tracks aircraft such as airplanes, helicopters, and drones.
                    In order to track these aircraft, this interface integrates hardware such as radars and ADS-B. 
                    <br>
                    This interface shows real time data along with flight logs. It allows a user to create customised geographical warning zones) and 
                    receive notifications if the zone detects anything. It also allows for the user to filter detected aircraft by things such as 
                    altitude or speed.
                    When an aircraft is being detected inside a designated area, real-time alerts and notifications are displayed on the interface 
                    and can be sent to a device of the user's choice - including mobile phones and smart watches.
                    <br>
                    The target audience for this project is anywhere from individual people wanting to protect their garden
                    to enterprise busineses wanting to monitor and have protection from illegal drones.
                    It is also for authorities and air traffic managers to identify and track drones alongside other forms of aviation 
                    in their are of responsibility.
                    This is invaluable to a wide range of industries, including aviation, defence & security, insurance and more.

                    This product aims to provide individuals and bisnesses with full and comprehensive view of everything that flies,
                    in order to enable a safe sharing of our skies in the future. 
                    It increases airspace safety by improving awareness of what aircraft is in the skies, and allows for the user to then 
                    take action from the information that they are presented with.

                    "With full situational awareness, the skies are unlocked"

                <hr class="divider divider-light" />
                <p class="modal-text" align="center">
                    My role for this project was to be the Front End developer working in a small team alongside a senior developer
                    and a backend developer.
                    <br>
                    We used the agile workflow in order to keep track of the project. I would have to report back to the senior developer each time I completed a Jira ticket,
                    he would then review my work and give feedback on it.  
                    <br>
                    There were no assigned designers, so the design of the website was decided by the CEO or as a joint effort amongst the dev team.
                    This project was started in February 2021 and it is still ongoing.

                    WordPress was also used in order to create a corresponding blog; I created the entire blog by heavily modifying a template
                    in order to match AeroTracker's design.

                    What I learned whilst doing this project:
                    I have had the amazing opportunity to work alongside a brilliant senior developer. I have also enhanced my Front End developer skills
                    and learned new technologies.
